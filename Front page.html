	<h1>Alex Berry's website</h1>
	<p>Hello. Welcome to my website.</p>
<p>This website shows lots of my work from 10COM. It currently contains my work from my first project, photoshop and my second one, premiere pro while also being my third project, website building. There's about a 50% chance if we are not made to continue it that I will update it with my other projects</p>
<p>This is the front page which currently contains links to: A gallery of my photoshop images, A basic page containing my video, and a page I had to create which has them all and is my website building project.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy it. I had a lot of fun making it and learnt lots.</p>
